    "After `using LinearAlgebra`, **Julia speaks linear algebra fluently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing linear algebra operations on a computer is, of course, an old problem. Lots of amazing libraries have been written - mostly in Fortran - which have been optimized over decades. Basically all high-level programming languages use these libraries, including R, Python, and Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra in Julia is largely implemented by calling [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/)/[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) functions. As per default, Julia uses [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BLAS**: a collection of low-level matrix and vector arithmetic operations (\"multiply two matrices\", \"multiply a matrix by vector\").\n",
    "* **LAPACK**:  a collection of higher-level linear algebra operations. Things like matrix factorizations (LU, LLt, QR, SVD, Schur, etc) that are used to do things like “find the eigenvalues of a matrix”, or “find the singular values of a matrix”, or “solve a linear system”.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Sparse matrices are more difficult and there exist different collections of routines, one of which is [SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do I have to care?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are multiple BLAS/LAPACK implementations (e.g. by different vendors) and switching between them can lead to **big speedups**! 😄\n",
    "* Since you might be leaving the world of Julia code, **you loose easy inspectability and type genericity**. 😢"
