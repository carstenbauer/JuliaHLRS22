# Exercises: Performance Optimization

There are two similar exercises `perf_optimization1` and `perf_optimization2`. The second is probably a bit more difficult to optimize than the first.

The exercises are provided as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and script files (`*.jl`).
You are free to choose which variant you want to work with. Depending on whether you want to use Jupyter lab or VS Code on your laptop or the cluster one or the other format might be more convenient.
